     >About Me</h2>

  
    <p> I was born and raised in the Kansas City, Kansas where I was educated. I graduated <br>from high school in the top 10% of my class and earned several academic awards. I <br>began my undergraduate studies at Kansas City, Kansas Community College on a <br> Presidential Honors Scholarship. and graduated. I continued my studies in Lawrence, <br> Kansas at The University of Kansas where I studied Accounting. After being faced <br> with the end to a 10 year career in manufacturing, I returned to college and it was at <br> the University of Phoenix-Kansas City where I completed my degree in Business <br> Management in 2008. Recently, I decided to switch careers and took on a new endea- <br> vor to become a Software Engineer through Momentum@Morehouse </p>

    <p> When I am not working, you may find me in a kitchen cooking for friends and/or family. <br> (The kitchen is my happy place!) I also enjoy reading, doing puzzles, and traveling</p>.
